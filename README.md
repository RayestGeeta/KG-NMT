KG-NMT - Knowledge Graph-augmented NMT
=========

### About
This project aims at delivering a framework which uses knowledge graphs into Neural Networks for augmenting the translation of entities in texts.

### Required steps 

Please first run

```
./install.sh
./download_data.sh en de - it is for reproducing the results from our paper

```

### Running steps 

If you want to run the first strategy of KG-NMT which relies on the use of Knowledge Graph embeddigns with Entity Link task, you should run
```
1. ./kg-nmt_KGE+EL_workflow.sh
```

In case you want to run the second strategy of KG-NMT which relies on the use of Knowledge Graph embeddigns enriched with textual descriptions, please run
```
2. ./kg-nmt_SemKGE_workflow.sh
```
 
### Structure

KG-NMT currently consists of the following modules:

1. OpenNMT-py - NMT submodule component, you can change it for a tensorflow implementation or another NMT system
2. fastText - responsible for creating knowledge graph embeddings, you can also change it for another KGE implementation
3. KG-NMT workflows - they are responsible for creating both strategies described in our paper
4. Entiy Linker - the component responsible for annotating the entities in the billingual parallel corpora, you can also replace for another EL system.
